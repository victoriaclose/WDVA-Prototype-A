                The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Program attempts to create community-based avenues to counseling service that are less formal in nature, offering the highest level of confidentiality possible. Services provided throughout the program include individual, couples, family, and veteran group counseling. Some contractors offer group services to women veterans and spouses of veterans. Veterans may be referred to specialized inpatient or outpatient treatment offered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers or Vet Centers within Washington State.   

Our licensed mental health professional contractors offer a wide range of specialized treatment services, as well as linkage to a variety of other services. Current contractors have an average of 24 years of direct service experience in the field of mental health.

 

<div id="eligibility"><h2>Eligibility</h2>
Honorably discharged war era (any of the nation’s war or peacekeeping periods) veterans and his/her family members           

Washington State National Guard or Military Reserve members deployed in support of the nation’s war and peacekeeping missions, and their family members

The veteran does not need to be suffering from or diagnosed with PTSD, but should be able to demonstrate significant post war adjustment issues to warrant outpatient care

No VA service connected disability for any condition is required for this service within the WDVA PTSD Program

Services are free to qualified veterans

Priority is given to those most vulnerable or having no other reasonable options for care.

<div id="child"><h2>School Aged Children of War Exposed Veterans</h2>

Additional counseling and consulting resources are being used to educate teachers and school counselors of the potential needs of school aged children of war exposed parents. Secondary and/or transgenerational trauma reactions in children can affect their ability to attend and learn successfully. We know that a child’s social behavior, emotional development, and the skills a child needs to be successful in the wider world, may be affected by the presence of untreated PTSD in the family. Early identification and referral of children and families who are demonstrating specific reactions are a significant priority of the PTSD Program. 

Services to Higher Education
The PTSD Program provides in-service training and consultation to college and university counseling and other professional staff, and faculty members. This special program is designed to address the needs of war exposed  veterans who have returned to school after discharge from the military, and who seek assistance at student counseling centers on campus. Along with expert help with counseling methods, military and veteran cultural awareness training, providers are given instruction in how to use the sometimes complex services network available to war veterans and their family members. University and college counselors are encouraged to call the PTSD Program Director for more information.
